description: "Configure fallback and multi-deployment routing strategies for liter-llm."
title: "Fallback and Routing"
---

Liter-llm provides two composable Tower layers for multi-deployment scenarios: `FallbackLayer` for primary-plus-backup patterns, and `Router` for distributing load across a fleet of deployments with five selectable strategies.

## Fallback

`FallbackLayer` wraps a primary service with a single backup service. When the primary fails with a transient error, the same request is replayed on the fallback.

Non-transient errors (`Authentication`, `BadRequest`, `ContextWindowExceeded`, `ContentPolicy`, `NotFound`, `EndpointNotSupported`, `Serialization`, `InvalidHeader`, `HookRejected`) propagate immediately without consulting the fallback, because retrying them on a different endpoint produces the same result.

Transient errors that trigger the fallback: `RateLimited`, `ServiceUnavailable`, `Timeout`, `ServerError`, `Network`.

```rust
use liter_llm::tower::{FallbackLayer, LlmService};
use tower::{Layer, ServiceBuilder};

let primary = LlmService::new(openai_client);
let backup  = LlmService::new(anthropic_client);

let service = FallbackLayer::new(backup).layer(primary);
```

:::caution[Streaming buffer]
When `LlmService` is used inside the Tower stack, streaming responses (`ChatStream`) are fully buffered in memory before being yielded. This is required by Tower's `Service` trait, which mandates `'static` futures. All chunks are collected into a `VecDeque` and replayed. If unbuffered streaming is required, call `LlmClient::chat_stream()` directly, bypassing the Tower stack.
:::

## Router

`Router` distributes `LlmRequest`s across multiple service instances according to a `RoutingStrategy`. All deployments must be `Clone`.

```rust
use liter_llm::tower::{LlmService, Router, RoutingStrategy};

let deployments = vec![
    LlmService::new(client_us_east),
    LlmService::new(client_eu_west),
    LlmService::new(client_us_west),
];

let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::RoundRobin)?;
```

`Router::new` returns `LiterLlmError::BadRequest` if `deployments` is empty.

## Routing strategies

| Strategy         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RoundRobin`     | Cycles through deployments in order using an atomic counter.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Fallback`       | Tries deployments in order. Advances to the next on a transient error. Returns the last error when all deployments fail.                                                                                                                     |
| `LatencyBased`   | Routes to the deployment with the lowest observed latency using an exponential moving average (alpha = 0.3). Deployments with no data default to EMA 0.0 (treated as fastest).                                                               |
| `CostBased`      | Tries deployments in order, logging estimated USD cost per response. In the current implementation, routes identically to `Fallback` while cost telemetry is recorded. Per-deployment provider metadata for true cost comparison is planned. |
| `WeightedRandom` | Selects a deployment by weighted random distribution. Weights need not sum to 1.0; they are used as relative proportions.                                                                                                                    |

### RoundRobin

```rust
let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::RoundRobin)?;
```

Requests are distributed evenly in a cycle. All deployments receive traffic regardless of health.

### Fallback

```rust
let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::Fallback)?;
```

Tries each deployment in order. Only transient errors (same set as `FallbackLayer`) advance to the next. Non-transient errors short-circuit immediately.

### LatencyBased

```rust
let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::LatencyBased)?;
```

After each request completes, the observed wall-clock latency is folded into a per-deployment exponential moving average:

```text
EMA_new = 0.3 * sample + 0.7 * EMA_prev
```

The first sample for a deployment seeds the EMA directly. The deployment with the lowest EMA is selected on the next call. Deployments with no data have EMA 0.0 and are selected first (optimistic default).

### CostBased

```rust
let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::CostBased)?;
```

Attempts deployments in order. On a successful response, logs the estimated USD cost at `TRACE` level. Advances on transient errors. Pricing data comes from the embedded registry at `crates/liter-llm/schemas/pricing.json`.

### WeightedRandom

```rust
let router = Router::new(
    deployments,
    RoutingStrategy::WeightedRandom {
        weights: vec![3.0, 2.0, 1.0],
    },
)?;
```

The `weights` vec must have the same length as `deployments` and the total must be positive. Weight 3.0 means a deployment receives roughly three times as much traffic as one with weight 1.0.

`Router::new` returns `LiterLlmError::BadRequest` if the weights length does not match deployments or if all weights are zero.

## Composing with other layers

`Router` and `FallbackLayer` compose with the rest of the Tower stack. Budget, rate limit, cooldown, health, and tracing layers all wrap the same `Service<LlmRequest>` interface.

The proxy server wires the layers in this order (outermost to innermost): Tracing, Cost, Cache, Budget, RateLimit, Cooldown, Health, Fallback, Router.

```rust
use liter_llm::tower::{
    CostTrackingLayer, FallbackLayer, LlmService, Router, RoutingStrategy, TracingLayer,
};
use tower::ServiceBuilder;

let primary = Router::new(
    vec![LlmService::new(client_a), LlmService::new(client_b)],
    RoutingStrategy::LatencyBased,
)?;
let backup = LlmService::new(fallback_client);

let service = ServiceBuilder::new()
    .layer(TracingLayer)
    .layer(CostTrackingLayer)
    .layer(FallbackLayer::new(backup))
    .service(primary);
```

## Proxy configuration

In the proxy server, per-model fallbacks are declared in the `[[models]]` table:

```toml
[[models]]
name = "gpt-4o"
provider_model = "openai/gpt-4o"
fallbacks = ["gpt-4o-azure", "gpt-4-fallback"]

[[models]]
name = "gpt-4o-azure"
provider_model = "azure/gpt-4o"
api_key = "${AZURE_API_KEY}"

[[models]]
name = "gpt-4-fallback"
provider_model = "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
api_key = "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
```

The proxy applies the `Fallback` strategy for `fallbacks` lists and selects the `RoutingStrategy` configured in `[general].routing_strategy`. See [Proxy Configuration](/server/proxy-configuration/) for the full field reference.

See [Error Handling](/usage/error-handling/) for the full list of transient vs. non-transient error variants.
