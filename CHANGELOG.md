## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **publish workflow**: migrate every push, release-asset upload, and homebrew-tap commit to the `kreuzberg-dev-publisher[bot]` GitHub App via `actions/create-github-app-token@v2`, replacing `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` and `secrets.HOMEBREW_TOKEN` with scoped app installation tokens.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-07

### Security

External security audit identified six exploitable gaps in the v1.4.1 codebase. All six are fixed here with regression tests; releasing as a minor version because three of them change defaults.

- **(F1, CRITICAL) Master-key constant-time comparison** — `KeyStore::is_master_key` previously compared the bearer token to the configured master key via `==`, exposing a per-request timing sidechannel. Now stores the master key in `secrecy::SecretString` and compares via `subtle::ConstantTimeEq::ct_eq` on the raw bytes. (`crates/liter-llm-proxy/src/auth/key_store.rs`, new `subtle = "2.6"` dep in `crates/liter-llm-proxy/Cargo.toml`.)
- **(F2, HIGH, BREAKING) SSRF guard on outbound provider URLs** — `CustomProviderConfig::base_url` accepted arbitrary URLs and the `reqwest::Client` had no DNS-resolution policy, so a malicious custom-provider registration could point at `127.0.0.1` / `169.254.169.254` / RFC1918 networks. New `liter_llm::provider::OutboundPolicy { Off, DenyPrivate, Allowlist(_) }` chokepoint validates URLs at registration time and a `GuardedResolver` re-applies the policy per-request via `reqwest`'s `dns_resolver` hook, including redirect-hop validation. Library default is `Off` (back-compat preserves embedded/FFI behaviour); proxy default is `DenyPrivate`. New `LiterLlmError::OutboundForbidden` variant maps to HTTP 502. New TOML key `[security] outbound_policy = "deny_private" | "off" | { allowlist = ["…"] }`. (`crates/liter-llm/src/provider/outbound_policy.rs`, `crates/liter-llm/src/provider/custom.rs`, `crates/liter-llm/src/client/mod.rs`, `crates/liter-llm-proxy/src/config/server.rs`, `crates/liter-llm-cli/src/commands/serve.rs`.)
- **(F3, HIGH, BREAKING) MCP per-tool model-access gate + HTTP transport auth** — every `#[tool]` handler in `crates/liter-llm-proxy/src/mcp/mod.rs` (chat, embed, list_models, generate_image, speech, transcribe, moderate, rerank, search, ocr, create_response, plus all file and batch management tools) now resolves a `KeyContext` from the rmcp `RequestContext.extensions` and pre-flight-checks `can_access_model(&params.model)` or `is_master` before routing through `ServicePool` / `FileStore`. The HTTP/SSE MCP transport mounted in `crates/liter-llm-cli/src/commands/mcp.rs` is wrapped with the same `validate_api_key` middleware as the OpenAI endpoint, so virtual-key restrictions apply uniformly. Stdio transport requires an explicit `mcp.stdio_key_id` / `mcp.stdio_trust_local = true` opt-in or refuses to start.
- **(F4, MED-HIGH) Error message sanitization** — SSE error events and `ProxyError::from(LiterLlmError)` previously embedded raw provider error strings via `Display` with no truncation or control-character handling. New `crates/liter-llm-proxy/src/error.rs::sanitize_message` (UTF-8-safe 200-char truncation, control-character strip except `\t`/`\n`) is applied at the single `From<LiterLlmError>` chokepoint; SSE payloads now build via `serde_json` rather than string interpolation, and `ProxyError::to_sse_payload` is the canonical serializer.
- **(F5, MED-HIGH) Mutex poisoning recovery** — `SyncService::clone_service` (`crates/liter-llm/src/client/managed.rs`) previously panicked when the inner `std::sync::Mutex` was poisoned. The lock guard only protects the clone step over a `BoxCloneService`, which is `Clone` and stateless across the lock, so recovery is safe: poisoned guards are now reclaimed via `PoisonError::into_inner` and the next request proceeds normally.
- **(F7, MED-HIGH, BREAKING) CORS default is empty + wildcard origin loses Authorization header** — the proxy's `default_cors()` is now `vec![]` instead of `vec!["*"]`; with no `cors_origins`, the router skips the `CorsLayer` entirely. When `cors_origins` is set to `"*"`, the wildcard branch restricts `allow_headers` to a fixed list (`CONTENT_TYPE`, `ACCEPT`, …) and explicitly does **not** include `Authorization` — wildcard origins must not see credentialed headers per CORS-fetch spec. `liter-llm-cli serve` also logs a `tracing::warn!` when `cors_origins.contains("*") && host == "0.0.0.0"`.

### Changed

- **Bindings regenerated against alef v0.23.28** (was v0.23.16). All 16 language surfaces — Python, Node, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, Kotlin Android, C#, Elixir, WASM, C/FFI, Zig, Dart, Swift, R, Homebrew — and the e2e suites refresh end-to-end. The new alef ships my upstream java/magnus/go template patches (PMD braces, jinja whitespace, `MethodHandle.invoke` `throws Throwable` wrap, `data_enum` close-brace, magnus top-level module doc) plus the parallel agent's brew/zig/php/dart/snippets/kotlin/swift fixes.
- **Tighter Rust clippy allow surface** in the core and proxy crates: removed three unused `#[allow]` annotations, the unused `get_json` helper in `crates/liter-llm/src/http/request.rs`, and a now-dead `serde::de::DeserializeOwned` import. `cargo clippy --workspace … -- -D warnings` is clean without the deleted suppressions.

### Tooling

- **`kreuzberg-dev/pre-commit-hooks` bumped to v2.1.10** — picks up the consumer-side `alef-sync-versions --no-regen` fix (full regen no longer fires on every commit), the palantir-java-format multi-platform sha256 manifest acceptance, the ktfmt checksum entry, and the `godoc-lint` / `golangci-lint` go.work-aware module discovery (no longer scans stale `test_apps/swift_e2e/.build/checkouts/.../e2e/go/`).
- **Project-local PMD ruleset** at `packages/java/pmd-ruleset.xml` wired into the `pmd` hook to suppress alef-generated FFI patterns that PMD's quickstart ruleset misflags (`AvoidCatchingGenericException`, `PreserveStackTrace`, `CloseResource`, `UnusedLocalVariable`, `UnnecessaryFullyQualifiedName`, `VariableCanBeInlined`, `ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull`).
- **`deny.toml`** ignores `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` (Marvin Attack timing sidechannel in `rsa@0.9.x`, transitive via `opendal -> reqsign-core`). No safe upstream version yet; the underlying RSA private-key signing path is not exercised on our network-observable code paths.
- **`alef-docs-fresh` hook and the CI `Verify alef-generated code is up-to-date` step soft-disabled** pending an alef v0.23.28 `inputs-hash` regression fix — `alef verify` currently flags files as stale immediately after a fresh `alef all` run (the hash recomputed during verify disagrees with the hash written at emit time).
- **`markdownlint-rumdl-strict`** exclude expanded to cover the root `README.md` (alef-generated badge row uses inline HTML), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `templates/readme/`, and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

### Migration notes

The three behaviour-changing defaults above (`cors_origins = []`, `outbound_policy = "deny_private"`, MCP per-tool model gate) are all reversible via explicit config. Operators who relied on the old defaults should add to their proxy config:

```toml
cors_origins = ["*"]                # opt back into the v1.4.x wildcard CORS default
[security]
outbound_policy = "off"             # opt back into the v1.4.x unguarded outbound HTTP
```

Virtual-key holders who previously hit MCP tools without a model-access policy need their `[[virtual_keys]]` entries updated to include the model names they expect to call — or be granted `is_master = true`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **Docker build**: removed stale `COPY tools/ tools/` from `docker/Dockerfile` — the `tools/` directory was deleted in v1.3.0 and the unfixed copy was failing every Docker image build since.
- **`publish-crates` job timeout**: bumped `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` `publish-crates` `timeout-minutes` from 30 to 60. The 30-minute ceiling was cancelling mid-publish on busy `crates.io` index-propagation days, which (combined with the Python stdout buffering issue below) made cancelled runs look like silent failures with no per-crate log output.
- **Upstream `kreuzberg-dev/actions` to v1.8.29**: `publish-crates/scripts/publish.py` now line-buffers stdout/stderr (`sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=True)`), so per-crate "Publishing X (n/total)..." progress survives job cancellation. Before this fix, GitHub Actions' block-buffered Python stdout swallowed all in-flight progress when the job hit `timeout-minutes`, hiding which crate was actually mid-publish.

### Notes

- v1.4.0 was a no-op release because `task version:bump` was not run before tagging — the tree still carried `1.4.0-rc.61` in `Cargo.toml`, so every publish job either re-shipped `rc.61` artifacts (already on the registry) or failed verification looking for `1.4.0`. v1.4.1 is the first real `1.4.x` release.
- alef pin advanced to `0.23.16` (was `0.23.12`) — no functional codegen changes vs. `0.23.12`; bump tracks the latest released `0.23.x`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- `feat(provider/vertex): auto-install VertexAdcCredentialProvider in DefaultClient::new` — when the resolved provider is `vertex_ai` and the caller supplied neither an explicit `api_key` nor a `credential_provider`, the client now auto-constructs `VertexAdcCredentialProvider::new()` and installs it on the config. This is the canonical auth path for GKE Workload Identity / Cloud Run / Compute Engine deployments — short-lived OAuth2 tokens are fetched from the metadata server (with a `gcp_auth` ADC discovery fallback for local development) and cached with a 5-minute pre-expiry refresh buffer. Pre-obtained tokens supplied via `api_key` and explicit `credential_provider`s continue to take precedence. The ADC module is now reachable through the `native-http` feature (gated behind `native-http` instead of `vertex-adc`, with `vertex-adc` retained as a back-compat alias).
- `feat(provider/azure): per-model `base_url` overrides for Azure deployments` — `[[models]]` entries that pin a `base_url` for an `azure/...` `provider_model` now route through `AzureProvider::with_base_url(...)`, producing the required `{base_url}/openai/deployments/{model}{path}?api-version=…` shape instead of the generic OpenAI-compatible URL. Unblocks multi-resource Azure setups (different deployments per region/subscription). Closes #83.
- `feat(wasm-backend): emit chat_stream returning JS async iterator` — the WASM binding now exposes `WasmDefaultClient.chat_stream(req)` alongside the existing `chat`, `embed`, etc. The streaming adapter buffers the underlying `BoxStream<ChatCompletionChunk>` into an array and returns it as a `JsValue`, mirroring the NAPI binding's streaming semantics.
- CLI binary tarballs (Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS aarch64, Windows x86_64) attached to GitHub Releases for direct download — closes #64.
- `schemas/pricing.json` regenerated from [models.dev](https://models.dev) and now covers 4,219 models (up from 35); `scripts/generate_pricing.py` wired into `task generate:pricing`, `task update`, and `task upgrade`. Closes #48.
- `Usage::prompt_tokens_details` (`{ cached_tokens, audio_tokens }`) deserialised from the OpenAI-compatible response body, plus `cost::completion_cost_with_cache` and matching `cache_read_input_token_cost` / `cache_creation_input_token_cost` fields on `ModelPricing`. `ChatCompletionResponse::estimated_cost` and the `CostTrackingLayer` now bill cached prompt tokens at the provider's discounted cache-read rate. `schemas/pricing.json` carries cache-read/cache-creation costs for the 1,500+ models on models.dev that publish them. Closes #65.
- `ci-mobile`: new `.github/workflows/ci-mobile.yaml` running `android-check` (ubuntu, `arm64-v8a` + `x86_64` via `cargo ndk`), `ios-check` (macos, `aarch64-apple-ios` + `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`), and `xcframework-build` (macos, SPM-ready XCFramework + SHA256 checksum). Uses shared composite actions from `kreuzberg-dev/actions@v1`.
- **Alef migration to v0.23.11**: the entire polyglot surface (16 language bindings — Python, Node, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, C#, Kotlin Android, Elixir, WASM, C/FFI, Zig, Dart, Swift, Homebrew + Rust core) is regenerated end-to-end via [alef](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/alef). Streaming (`chat_stream`) is available across every applicable language, including Go (cgo channel bridge), Dart (FRB v2 `StreamSink<T>`), and WASM. Skipped-assertion total across e2e suites: 354 → 0.

### Changed

- **API rename**: `ResponseClient::retrieve_response` / `cancel_response` now take a parameter named `response_id` (was `id`). Positional callers are unaffected; named-arg callers must update. Consistent with `file_id` / `batch_id` on the file and batch clients, and unblocks the alef-generated Python binding from shadowing the `id` builtin.
- **GitHub Release CLI assets** ship a single sorted `SHA256SUMS-<version>.txt` instead of one `.sha256` per archive — closes #67.
- **WebAssembly build verified `mio`-free.** `liter-llm` exposes two mutually exclusive HTTP-stack features — `native-http` (reqwest + tokio + memchr + base64) and `wasm-http` (reqwest + memchr + base64 + gloo-timers, _no_ tokio). `liter-llm-wasm` enables only `wasm-http`; reqwest is pinned with `default-features = false, features = ["json", "stream", "rustls", "multipart", "form"]`. `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p liter-llm-wasm` pulls neither `mio` nor `tokio` — reqwest auto-routes to the browser/Node `fetch` API on `wasm32` targets.
- **Ruby publish** vendors core crates exclusively via the shared `kreuzberg-dev/actions/rewrite-native-deps@v1` action (alef `publish prepare`, `vendor_mode = "core-only"`). The bespoke `scripts/ci/ruby/vendor-liter-llm-core.py`, the local `ruby:vendor` Task, and the `ruby:build` dependency on it are removed.
- **Repo hygiene**: `.gitattributes` marks all alef-generated output directories (`packages/**`, `crates/*-{py,php,ffi,node,wasm}/**`, `e2e/**`) as `linguist-generated=true` so generated files collapse in GitHub PR diffs.

### Fixed

- **TLS ABI floor**: reqwest crypto provider switched from `aws-lc-rs` to `ring` (`rustls-no-provider` feature + explicit `rustls` dep with `ring` backend). Eliminates `__isoc23_strtol` and related glibc 2.38+ symbols emitted by `aws-lc-sys` 0.40.0, restoring the GLIBC_2.28 ABI floor required by downstream users (e.g. Node.js aarch64 bindings).
- **HTTP retry jitter on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`**: the jitter calculation called `std::time::SystemTime::now()` which panics with `RuntimeError: unreachable` on bare wasm32 (std time is not implemented). On `wasm32` the jitter step is skipped; native targets keep the existing `[0.5x, 1.0x]` jitter. Unblocks WASM e2e tests that exercise 429/5xx retry paths.
- **WASM and JNI bindings** no longer fail to compile against the `tokenizer`-gated `count_tokens` / `count_request_tokens` functions. Both now `exclude_functions` in `alef.toml`; apps that need token counting on those targets should call a server-side endpoint.
- **C/FFI header** emits the opaque `typedef struct LITERLLMLiterLlmError LITERLLMLiterLlmError;` referenced by the `literllm_liter_llm_error_{status_code,is_transient,error_type}` accessors.
- **Java** `ResponseObject` / `ResponseTool` DTOs round-trip the full OpenAI Responses payload. `ResponseOutputItem.content` is a `List<…>` (was a misaligned `LinkedHashMap`); `ResponseTool` accepts `description` via the `@JsonAnyGetter` / `@JsonAnySetter` flatten path. Fixes `MismatchedInputException` and `UnrecognizedPropertyException` thrown by `createResponse` / `retrieveResponse` / `cancelResponse`.
- **Node (NAPI) streaming** HTTP-init errors (400 content-policy, 401 unauthorized on `chatStream`) now reject through the iterator. Binding remains lazy (parity with Python's `async for _ in stream: pass`).
- **Python `api.py` wrapper** emits the correct shape for non-streaming methods (22 `DefaultClient` ops). Previously every method was wrapped as a streaming `AsyncIterator`; only `chat_stream` is genuinely streaming now. Also fixes `String` → `str` and `bytes::Bytes` → `bytes` mappings.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Alef migration**: All language bindings are now auto-generated by [alef](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/alef) instead of hand-written

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `LlmClientRaw` trait with `_raw` variants of all `LlmClient` methods, returning `RawExchange<T>` that exposes the final request body and raw provider response before normalization ([#13](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/liter-llm/issues/13))
- `RawExchange<T>` and `RawStreamExchange<S>` types for wire-level debugging and custom parsing

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-29

OpenAI-compatible LLM proxy server with CLI, MCP tool server, and Docker support.

### Proxy Server (`liter-llm-proxy`)

- **22 REST endpoints** — full OpenAI-compatible API surface: chat completions (streaming + non-streaming), embeddings, models, images, audio (speech + transcription), moderations, rerank, search, OCR, files CRUD, batches CRUD, responses CRUD, health
- **Tower middleware stack** — reuses core middleware: cache, rate limit, budget, cost tracking, cooldown, health check, tracing
- **Virtual API keys** — in-memory key store with per-key model restrictions, RPM/TPM limits, budget limits
- **Model routing** — name-based routing to provider deployments, wildcard aliases, deterministic default client
- **OpenDAL file storage** — configurable backend (memory, S3, GCS, filesystem) for file operations
- **SSE streaming** — chat completion chunks proxied as Server-Sent Events with `[DONE]` sentinel
- **OpenAPI 3.1** — utoipa-generated spec served at `/openapi.json` with bearer auth security scheme
- **TOML configuration** — `liter-llm-proxy.toml` with env var interpolation (`${VAR}`), auto-discovery, `deny_unknown_fields`
- **CORS** — configurable origins from config (default: allow all)
- **Graceful shutdown** — SIGINT/SIGTERM handling via `tokio::signal`

### MCP Server (`rmcp`)

- **22 tools** — full parity with REST API: chat, embed, list_models, generate_image, speech, transcribe, moderate, rerank, search, ocr, file CRUD (5), batch CRUD (4), response CRUD (3)
- **Transports** — stdio (default) and HTTP/SSE via `StreamableHttpService`
- **Parameter schemas** — `schemars::JsonSchema` derives for MCP tool discovery

### CLI (`liter-llm`)

- `liter-llm api` — start proxy server with config, host/port overrides, debug logging
- `liter-llm mcp` — start MCP server with stdio or HTTP transport
- 3-tier config precedence: CLI flags > env vars > config file > defaults

### Docker

- Multi-stage build: `rust:1.91-bookworm` builder, `cgr.dev/chainguard/glibc-dynamic` runtime (35MB)
- Non-root execution, OCI labels, port 4000 exposed
- `ENTRYPOINT ["liter-llm"]`, `CMD ["api", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "4000"]`

### Testing

- **74 unit tests** — config parsing, error mapping, auth key store, service pool, file store, streaming
- **32 integration tests** — auth middleware, chat/embedding/models routes, error propagation, CORS, health, OpenAPI
- **12 proxy e2e fixtures** — chat (basic + streaming), embeddings, models, auth errors, upstream errors, health, images, moderation, reranking
- **Schemathesis** — contract testing against OpenAPI spec via Docker (`task proxy:schemathesis`)

### CI/CD

- `.github/workflows/ci-docker.yaml` — build + health test + schemathesis contract tests
- `.github/workflows/publish-docker.yaml` — multi-arch (amd64/arm64) publish to `ghcr.io/kreuzberg-dev/liter-llm`
- Taskfile: `proxy:test`, `proxy:schemathesis`

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-28

Initial stable release. Universal LLM API client with native bindings for 11 languages and 142+ providers.

### Core

- `LlmClient` trait with chat, chat_stream, embed, list_models, image_generate, speech, transcribe, moderate, rerank, search, ocr
- `FileClient`, `BatchClient`, `ResponseClient` traits for file/batch/response operations
- `DefaultClient` with reqwest + tokio, SSE streaming, retry with exponential backoff
- `ManagedClient` with composable Tower middleware stack
- 142 LLM providers embedded at compile time from `schemas/providers.json`
- Per-request provider routing from model name prefix (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- `secrecy::SecretString` for API keys (zeroized on drop, never logged)
- TOML configuration file loading with auto-discovery (`liter-llm.toml`)
- Custom provider registration at runtime

### Middleware (Tower)

- **CacheLayer** — in-memory LRU + pluggable backends via `CacheStore` trait
- **OpenDAL cache** — 40+ storage backends (Redis, S3, GCS, filesystem, etc.) via Apache OpenDAL
- **BudgetLayer** — global + per-model spending limits with hard/soft enforcement
- **HooksLayer** — request/response/error lifecycle callbacks with guardrail pattern
- **CooldownLayer** — circuit breaker after transient errors
- **ModelRateLimitLayer** — per-model RPM/TPM rate limiting
- **HealthCheckLayer** — background health probing
- **CostTrackingLayer** — per-request cost calculation from embedded pricing registry
- **TracingLayer** — OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic convention spans
- **FallbackLayer** — automatic failover to backup provider
- **RouterLayer** — multi-deployment load balancing (round-robin, latency, cost, weighted)

### Language Bindings

All bindings expose the full API surface with language-idiomatic conventions:

- **Python** (PyO3) — async/await, typed kwargs, full .pyi stubs
- **TypeScript / Node.js** (NAPI-RS) — camelCase, .d.ts types, Promise-based
- **Rust** — native, zero-cost
